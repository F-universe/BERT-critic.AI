Introduction
This project uses a fine-tuned BERT model to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews. The model predicts whether a review is positive, neutral, or negative.

Installation
To run the code, you need to have Python installed. You also need the following libraries:

Transformers
Provides pre-trained models like BERT and tools for NLP tasks.
Install it using:

bash

pip install transformers
Torch (PyTorch)
Used for tensor computations and deep learning operations.
Install it using:

bash

pip install torch
How It Works
Model and Tokenizer Loading
The project uses the pre-trained BERT model nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment, fine-tuned for sentiment analysis. The tokenizer converts input text into token IDs compatible with BERT.

python

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
Sentiment Prediction
The function predict_batch_sentiment takes a list of reviews, tokenizes them, and passes them through the model. It interprets the modelâ€™s output logits to classify each review as:

Positive
Neutral
Negative
python

def predict_batch_sentiment(reviews):
    # Tokenizes, processes, and predicts sentiment for each review.
Batch Processing
The script processes multiple reviews in a single run, making it efficient for analyzing large datasets of text.

Usage
Add your reviews to the more_reviews list.
Run the script to analyze sentiments:
bash

python sentiment_analysis.py
The output will show each review alongside its predicted sentiment.
Utility
Film Critique: Analyze user-generated reviews to identify the general sentiment about a movie.
Market Analysis: Apply it to other domains like product reviews for customer sentiment insights.
Social Media Analysis: Use it to assess public opinion on various topics.
This tool is versatile and can be easily adapted for different types of textual sentiment analysis tasks.
